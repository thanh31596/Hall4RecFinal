\begin{abstract}
Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented potential for semantic exploration in recommendation systems, enabling the discovery of diverse and contextually relevant items that surpass the capabilities of traditional collaborative filtering. However, this exploration capability comes with a critical challenge: LLMs hallucinate non-existent items at rates of 15-25\%, creating a perceived trade-off between semantic diversity and factual accuracy. We present HallAgent4Rec, a unified framework that transforms this trade-off into a synergy, enabling safe semantic exploration that achieves both higher diversity and better accuracy than either paradigm alone.%This fundamental problem stems from the semantic-algebraic disconnect between LLMs' continuous reasoning space and the discrete, constrained nature of recommendation catalogs. We present HallAgent4Rec, a mathematically unified framework that integrates collaborative filtering with generative agents while structurally eliminating hallucinations. 
Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) an attention-based fusion mechanism that combines collaborative filtering embeddings with LLM-generated personality vectors through learned projection matrices, (2) a hybrid bilinear scoring function that grounds predictions in actual item features while enabling efficient online adaptation via reduced-rank regression, and (3) an adaptive hallucination replacement strategy that balances semantic similarity with predicted user relevance through parameter-free optimisation. The framework operates through a computationally efficient offline-online learning paradigm that extracts semantic information offline and performs real-time adaptation without expensive LLM queries. Extensive experiments on three public datasets (MovieLens-1M, Amazon Electronics, Yelp) demonstrate that HallAgent4Rec reduces hallucination rates by 32-87\% compared to state-of-the-art baselines while improving recommendation quality. %The framework's mathematical design makes hallucinations structurally impossible through feature grounding, representing a fundamental advance toward reliable generative recommendation systems.

\section{Introduction}

Recommender systems have become integral components of online platforms, helping users navigate vast lists of content and products. The emergence of generative recommendation agents—powered by large language models (LLMs)—has opened new possibilities for personalised, context-aware recommendations. These agents can interpret user preferences through natural language, retain memory of past interactions, and generate nuanced recommendations with rich explanations \cite{park2024llm, kang2023conversationalrec}. Their semantic understanding of both user intent and item attributes allows them to surpass traditional methods in delivering personalised experiences \cite{baltrunas2015frappe}.

% Despite this promise, generative recommendation agents remain prone to a reliability flaw: faithfulness hallucinations, where systems recommend non-existent items or misattribute features to real items. We define faithfulness hallucinations as recommendations of items that do not exist in the provided list of candidates. Current generative recommendation approaches suffer from hallucination rates of 15-25\% across standard benchmarks, directly undermining user trust and business viability \cite{thompson2024user}. Unlike hallucinations in conversational AI agents, recommendation hallucinations have immediate practical consequences. Users cannot engage with items that do not exist, resulting in system failures and a degraded user experience.
Despite this promise, a fundamental challenge prevents realizing the full potential of LLM-based recommendation systems: the exploration-exploitation trade-off in the presence of hallucinations. While LLMs excel at semantic exploration discovering diverse, they hallucinate non-existent items at rates of 15-25\% across standard benchmarks \cite{thompson2024user}. This creates a dilemma: pure collaborative filtering methods exploit known patterns but suffer from filter bubbles and limited diversity, while LLM-based methods explore semantic spaces but compromise factual accuracy. Current approaches treat this as an either-or choice, failing to harness the complementary strengths of both paradigms.

The core technical challenge is enabling safe semantic exploration in recommendation systems to leverage LLMs' ability to discover diverse, semantically coherent recommendations while ensuring all suggestions are grounded in real items. This requires not just detecting and correcting hallucinations, but understanding that hallucinated recommendations often contain valuable semantic insights. For instance, when an LLM recommends a non-existent-in-the-list 'Toy Story 4' to a Pixar fan, the semantic pattern (animated sequels) is valid even if the specific item is not. The solution must preserve these semantic insights while ensuring factual accuracy, ultimately achieving better diversity and discovery than either paradigm alone.

More fundamentally, current generative recommendation approaches fail to recognize \textbf{that hallucinations can be a feature}, not just a bug. hey reveal semantic patterns and user preferences that pure collaborative filtering might miss. The challenge is not eliminating LLM reasoning but making it safe and productive. Pure collaborative filtering (CF) methods, such as matrix factorisation \cite{koren2009matrix} and neural collaborative filtering~\cite{he2017neural}, are highly effective at learning latent user and item vectors from interaction data but lack semantic understanding and struggle with contextual reasoning. Current generative approaches, while providing semantic richness, face severe computational limitations when deployed at scale. Existing generative recommendation techniques such as RecAgent \cite{wang2025user}, AgentCF \cite{zhang2024agentcf}, MACRec \cite{wang2024macrec}, and Agent4Rec \cite{zhang2024generative} are typically evaluated only on small subsets of datasets due to the prohibitive computational cost of querying LLMs for every recommendation request. This limitation makes real-time recommendations infeasible for large datasets with high query volumes, severely restricting their practical applicability. Hybrid methods \cite{sun2021bert4rec, wu2024llm} typically treat generative and collaborative components as loosely coupled systems with inconsistent optimisation objectives, preventing effective joint optimisation for both recommendation quality and computational efficiency. There is a need for a solution that is computationally tractable for large-scale deployment while preserving the benefits of both paradigms.

This paper introduces HallAgent4Rec, a novel framework that systematically addresses the research question: "\textbf{How can we enable safe semantic exploration in recommendation systems by combining the exploitation strength of collaborative filtering with the exploration capabilities of LLMs, while transforming hallucinations from a liability into an asset for discovering diverse, relevant recommendations?}". It addresses the core technical challenge of bridging the semantic space of LLMs with the algebraic structure of CF while maintaining computational efficiency at scale. HallAgent4Rec learns principled mappings between semantic vectors and collaborative latent factors, enables rapid online adaptation to new interactions without expensive LLM queries, and detects and corrects hallucinations while preserving semantic intent. 

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to identify and address the hallucination problem, despite being factually incorrect, which often contain valuable semantic intent that can be leveraged for improved predictions through our adaptive replacement strategy. Our key contributions include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Offline-Online Learning Strategy}: We design an efficient two-phase approach where semantic information is extracted offline and integrated with fast online adaptation through reduced-rank regression, making the framework scalable to large datasets with high query volumes.
\item \textbf{Unified CF-LLM Integration Framework}: We propose a framework that integrates CF with generative agents through attention-based fusion of collaborative embeddings and LLM personality vectors, with learned transfer matrices bridging item features and collaborative latent space.
\item \textbf{Hybrid Bilinear Scoring Function}: We introduce a unified scoring mechanism combining content-based transfer learning, collaborative signals, and online adaptation through reduced-rank regression, enabling joint leverage of behavioural patterns and semantic understanding.
\item \textbf{Safe Semantic Exploration Strategy}: We introduce a novel three-stage approach that enables LLMs to provide semantic diversity while ensuring factual accuracy through intelligent hallucination mitigation that preserves semantic intent rather than simply filtering errors.

\end{enumerate}

% Our work provides the first systematic approach to hallucination mitigation in generative recommendation systems that preserves the semantic richness of LLMs while ensuring factual reliability. The framework is model-agnostic and can be adapted to various underlying generative architectures and collaborative filtering techniques.

The rest of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 reviews related work, Section 3 presents our methodology, Section 4 describes experimental setup, Section 5 analyses results, and Section 6 concludes.


\section{Related Work}
This section positions our work within existing research by systematically analysing the three critical gaps that prevent practical deployment of agent-based recommendation systems: hallucination prevention, computational efficiency, and unified CF-LLM integration.

\subsection{Hallucination-Unaware Agent-Based Methods}
The majority of current agent-based recommendation systems ignore hallucination prevention, focusing on performance optimisation. AgentCF~\cite{zhang2024agentcf} introduces a dual-agent paradigm treating users and items as autonomous agents, achieving personalised behaviours through collaborative learning and reflection mechanisms. However, the framework provides no hallucination mitigation strategy, leaving systems vulnerable to generating non-existent recommendations that undermine user trust. Agent4Rec~\cite{zhang2024generative} demonstrates large-scale simulation with 1,000 LLM-empowered generative agents featuring emotion-driven reflection mechanisms. While achieving sophisticated user behaviour simulation at approximately \$16 cost, hallucination rates remain unmeasured and unaddressed. %, limiting practical deployment despite impressive simulation fidelity. 
RecAgent~\cite{wang2025user} pioneered the LLM-based simulation paradigm through dual user and recommender modules with browsing and communication capabilities. KuaiFormer~\cite{kuaiformer2024} achieves industrial-scale deployment serving 400M+ daily users with sub-millisecond latency through advanced transformer architectures, but addresses hallucinations only through bias correction without systematic prevention mechanisms.

These methods show that semantic understanding and personalisation are achievable through agent-based approaches; however, their complete neglect of hallucination prevention prevents reliable deployment in production environments where recommendation accuracy is critical.

\subsection{Post-Hoc Hallucination Correction Methods}
Several recent approaches attempt to mitigate hallucination through post-generation verification, but suffer from computational overhead and inability to preserve semantic intent. A-LLMRec~\cite{li2024allm} demonstrates model-agnostic hallucination mitigation by integrating pre-trained CF embeddings with LLM reasoning, achieving hallucination reduction from 47.5\% to 14.5\% through retrieval-augmented generation. However, this approach requires expensive verification processes that limit real-time applicability, and post-hoc replacement cannot recover the semantic intent of originally hallucinated recommendations. MACRec~\cite{wang2024macrec} employs multi-agent verification through the coordination of multiple personas, including Manager, User/Item Analyst, Reflector, Searcher, and Task Interpreter agents. While achieving superior performance in various recommendation tasks, the system requires 5 agent queries per recommendation, creating computational bottlenecks that prevent scalable deployment. LLMRec~\cite{liao2024llmrec} addresses hallucinations through denoised data robustification with graph augmentation strategies, but relies on post-hoc denoising approaches that cannot proactively prevent hallucination generation. The graph-based approach also limits applicability to scenarios with sufficient structural information.

These methods demonstrate that hallucination mitigation is achievable but highlight the fundamental limitation of post-hoc approaches: they require expensive verification processes and cannot preserve the semantic intent that makes generative recommendations valuable. Our framework addresses this fundamental gap through a unified design that makes hallucinations structurally impossible via feature grounding in the scoring function, eliminating the need for post-hoc detection while preserving the semantic understanding advantages of agent-based approaches.}

\subsection{Modular CF-LLM Integration Approaches}
Current hybrid approaches treat CF and LLM components as separate systems with independent optimisation objectives, preventing unified performance optimisation. InteRecAgent~\cite{liu2023interecagent} introduces the ``LLM as brain, CF as tools'' paradigm, featuring memory components and reflection mechanisms. However, tool-based separation creates inconsistent optimisation objectives and suffers from tool-switching overhead. % that complicates deployment.
BERT4Rec+MF~\cite{sun2021bert4rec} combines BERT-based sequential modelling with matrix factorisation through feature concatenation, representing a \loosely-coupled hybrid approach that treats collaborative and semantic components separately. LLM-CF~\cite{wu2024llm} uses LLMs to enhance CF representations, but maintains separate optimisation objectives for generative and collaborative components. ChatRec~\cite{gao2023chat} demonstrates conversational recommendation through ChatGPT-based in-context learning, but suffers from high per-conversation costs and lacks systematic optimisation of recommendation generation. KGLA~\cite{kgla2024} achieves 33-95\% NDCG@1 improvements through knowledge graph integration, but requires high KG query overhead and depends on knowledge graph completeness.

These approaches establish that CF-LLM integration provides performance benefits; however, their modular architectures with separate optimisation objectives prevent the unified framework necessary for joint optimisation of recommendation generation and hallucination mitigation.

% \section{Related Work}

% This section positions our work within existing research on generative recommendation agents, hybrid recommendation systems, and hallucination mitigation. We identify key limitations in current approaches that our unified framework addresses.

% \subsection{Generative Agents and Hallucination Challenges}

% Recent advances in LLMs have enabled generative recommendation systems that leverage semantic understanding to interpret user preferences and generate contextually relevant recommendations. Park et al. \cite{park2024llm} demonstrated that generative models could provide personalised recommendations with natural language explanations, while Kang and McAuley \cite{kang2023conversationalrec} enhanced this with conversational capabilities. Memory-augmented approaches like RecAgent \cite{mitchell2024recagent} and MemRec \cite{chen2024memrec} improved personalisation by maintaining structured user interaction histories.

% However, these systems face critical reliability challenges. Current generative recommendation approaches suffer from hallucination rates of 15-25% across standard benchmarks \cite{thompson2024user}, where systems recommend non-existent items or misattribute features to real items. Li et al. \cite{li2024taxonomy} classified these into faithfulness hallucinations (recommending non-existent items) and attribute hallucinations (misattributing features), with faithfulness hallucinations having the most significant impact on user trust \cite{thompson2024user}.

% Existing hallucination mitigation approaches, such as FactRec \cite{li2024factrec}, rely on computationally expensive post-generation verification processes that limit real-time applicability. General approaches like retrieval-augmented generation \cite{lewis2020retrieval} and constrained decoding \cite{yang2024constrained} often compromise the flexibility and personalisation capabilities that make generative recommenders valuable. \textbf{In contrast, our work integrates hallucination detection directly into the recommendation scoring process, enabling efficient mitigation without expensive post-generation verification.}

% \subsection{Hybrid Recommendation Systems and Integration Challenges}

% Traditional collaborative filtering methods like matrix factorisation \cite{koren2009matrix, salakhutdinov2007probabilistic} effectively capture user-item interaction patterns but lack semantic understanding of user preferences. Neural approaches such as Neural Collaborative Filtering \cite{he2017neural} and Deep Matrix Factorisation \cite{xue2017deep} improve performance through deep architectures but still cannot leverage the rich contextual reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

% Recent hybrid approaches attempt to combine generative modelling with collaborative filtering. Wu et al. \cite{wu2024llm} proposed using LLMs to enhance feature extraction for traditional recommenders, while Hou et al. \cite{hou2024collaborative} explored using collaborative filtering signals to guide generative outputs. However, these approaches treat generative and collaborative components as separate systems with inconsistent optimisation objectives, leading to information loss between components and inability to jointly address both recommendation quality and hallucination mitigation.

% Projection techniques for recommendation systems \cite{zhou2024similarity, wang2023projection} have shown that carefully designed matrices can maintain recommendation quality while reducing computational requirements. However, existing works have not addressed the fundamental challenge of creating principled mappings between the semantic space of generative models and the algebraic structure of collaborative filtering. \textbf{Our framework addresses this gap through learned transfer matrices that enable unified optimisation of both paradigms while preserving the benefits of each.}

% \subsection{Online Learning and Computational Efficiency}

% Online learning in recommendation systems \cite{wang2023online, kumar2023efficient} addresses the dynamic nature of user preferences and item catalogues. However, existing methods cannot simultaneously adapt both generative agent memories and collaborative filtering parameters, limiting their effectiveness for hybrid systems where both components must evolve coherently.

% Current generative recommendation methods face severe computational limitations when deployed at scale. Existing approaches like RecAgent \cite{mitchell2024recagent}, AgentCF \cite{zhang2024agentcf}, and Agent4Rec \cite{zhang2024generative} are typically evaluated only on small dataset subsets due to the prohibitive cost of querying LLMs for every recommendation request. This makes real-time recommendation infeasible for large datasets with high query volumes, severely restricting practical applicability.

% The reduced-rank regression approach introduced by Agarwal et al. \cite{agarwal2010fast} demonstrated how offline learning can initialise efficient online adaptation for time-sensitive recommendations. However, this work focused purely on collaborative filtering without addressing the integration challenges posed by generative agents or hallucination mitigation. \textbf{Our framework extends these principles to create a computationally efficient offline-online learning strategy that enables real-time generative recommendation at scale while maintaining hallucination detection capabilities.}

% The limitations identified above motivate our unified framework that: (1) integrates collaborative filtering with generative agents through learned projections, (2) enables efficient online adaptation without expensive LLM queries, and (3) provides principled hallucination detection and replacement while preserving semantic intent.

\section{Methodology}
In this section, we present HallAgent4Rec, a novel recommendation framework that addresses the critical challenge of hallucinations in generative recommendation agents. We begin with formal problem definitions and theoretical foundations, followed by detailed descriptions of our technical contributions.

    \caption{HallAgent4Rec Framework Architecture. The framework operates in three phases: \textbf{Phase 1} learns dual user representations by fusing collaborative filtering vectors ($u^{cf}_i$) and generative agent personality vectors ($u^{gen}_i$) through attention-based fusion, with transfer matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ enabling online adaptation. \textbf{Phase 2} performs online learning using a hybrid bilinear scoring function that combines content-based, online adaptation, and contextual components with real-time parameter updates. \textbf{Phase 3} detects and replaces hallucinated LLM recommendations using binary detection and rating-aware replacement that balances semantic similarity with predicted relevance through an adaptive parameter $\alpha$.}

\end{figure}
\subsection{Framework Overview}
\label{sec:framework_overview}

HallAgent4Rec addresses the fundamental challenge of hallucinations in generative recommendation systems through a unified two-phase framework that integrates collaborative filtering with generative agent modeling. Figure~\ref{fig:framework} illustrates our complete system architecture.
We employ a three-stage approach that balances accuracy, diversity, and factual grounding. The scoring function provides a strong accuracy baseline, the LLM introduces semantic exploration and diversity, and the replacement strategy ensures all recommendations exist while preserving semantic intent.

Unlike existing approaches that treat generative and collaborative components as separate systems, HallAgent4Rec creates a mathematically unified framework where both paradigms are jointly optimized to minimize recommendation error while explicitly reducing hallucination rates.
Table~\ref{tab:notation} summarizes our key mathematical notation. 
% Let $\mathcal{U} = \{u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n\}$ denote the set of $n$ users and $\mathcal{I} = \{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_m\}$ denote the set of $m$ items in the system list. 
The user-item interaction matrix $\mathbf{R} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ contains observed ratings, where $r_{ij} \in \mathbb{R}$ represents user $i$'s rating for item $j$. We use $r_{ij} = \perp$ to indicate unobserved interactions and define the set of observed interactions as $\Omega = \{(i,j) : r_{ij} \neq \perp\}$.

\label{tab:notation}
\begin{tabular}{cl}
\hline
\textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Description} \\

$u^{cf}_i$ & Collaborative filtering user vector for user $i$ \\

$\phi$ & Attention weight \\
$d$ & Shared latent space dimensionality for vector fusion \\
$x \in \mathbb{R}^m$ & item feature vector from the dataset representing $m$ features\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Problem Formulation:} Given generative agents that simulate user interactions and traditional collaborative filtering based on matrix $\mathbf{R}$, our objective is to develop a unified framework that: (1) integrates generative and collaborative paradigms through learned transfer matrices, and (2) addresses the hallucination problem: when LLM generates a non-existent item $\hat{j} \notin \mathcal{C}$, find optimal replacement $j^* \in \mathcal{C}$ that preserves semantic intent while ensuring factual accuracy through the optimization between item similarity and predicted preference.
\subsection{Dual User Representation Learning}
\label{sec:dual_representation}

Traditional collaborative filtering effectively captures behavioral patterns from historical user-item interactions but lacks semantic understanding of user preferences and contextual reasoning \cite{wang2025mitigating}. Conversely, generative agents excel at understanding personality traits and contextual nuances but cannot directly leverage the rich collaborative signals present in interaction histories. We propose fusing both paradigms to create comprehensive user vectors that combine the statistical strength of collaborative filtering with the semantic richness of generative modeling.

\subsubsection{Collaborative Filtering User Vectors}
\label{sec:cf_vectors}

Matrix factorization provides an effective approach for learning latent user vectors from historical interactions. By factorising the user-item interaction matrix $\mathbf{R}$, we can discover hidden factors that explain observed rating patterns and generalize to unobserved user-item pairs.

We obtain collaborative user latent vectors through the following optimization:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{U}^*, \mathbf{V}^* = \arg\min_{\mathbf{U}, \mathbf{V}} \sum_{(i,j) \in \Omega} \left(r_{ij} - (u^{cf}_i)^T v_j\right)^2 + \lambda_u \|\mathbf{U}\|^2_F + \lambda_v \|\mathbf{V}\|^2_F,
\label{eq:matrix_factorization}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{U} = [u^{cf}_1, \ldots, u^{cf}_n]^T \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$ contains all user latent vectors, $\mathbf{V} = [v_1, \ldots, v_m]^T \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times k}$ contains item latent vectors, and $\lambda_u, \lambda_v$ are regularization parameters to prevent overfitting. After optimization, individual user vectors $u^{cf}_i$ are extracted as the $i$-th row of the optimized matrix $\mathbf{U}^*$. In our implementation, we fully optimise Equation \ref{eq:matrix_factorization} with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) \cite{baltrunas2011incarmusic} to obtain the optimal matrices $\mathbf{U}^*$ and $\mathbf{V}^*$.
\subsubsection{Generative Agent Personality Vectors}
\label{sec:gen_vectors}

Inspired by Park et al.~\cite{park2023generative}, we construct generative agents to capture user personality traits and movie preferences that complement the behavioral patterns already captured in $u^{cf}_i$. Our approach focuses on deriving personality-based preferences from user demographics and genre consumption patterns rather than replicating interaction history. \textbf{For illustrative examples, the following section uses MovieLens-100k dataset to provide examples of how we extract a user vector using LLM.} Traditional recommendation approaches model $P(\text{preference} | \text{past behavior})$, whereas our generative agent approach models $P(\text{preference} | \text{personality}, \text{context})$. This distinction is crucial because personality traits provide stable, causal explanations for preferences that transcend specific item interactions. Unlike single-query LLMs that might generate inconsistent user descriptions, generative agents maintain coherent personality models through their memory and reflection mechanisms, ensuring behavioral consistency across different preference dimensions.

\textbf{Agent Initialization:} Each agent is initialized with a natural language description derived from MovieLens user metadata and computed genre preferences. We analyze each user's training data to extract:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Genre Preference Distribution}: For user $i$, we compute normalized genre frequency scores for each genre $n$ based on the training data..
    
    \item \textbf{Demographic-Based Personality Traits}: Using demographic data (age, occupation, location), we construct personality profiles that serve as observational inputs to the agent's memory stream.
\end{enumerate}

For example, a 25-year-old programmer with high action/sci-fi preferences initializes an agent with:
\begin{quote}
\textit{"User is a 25-year-old computer programmer from zip code of 55414. Based on their viewing patterns, they strongly prefer action movies (0.555), showing particular interest in technology-themed narratives (0.3335). They tend to avoid romantic comedies (0.000151) and dramas (0.000151)."}
\end{quote}

\textbf{Reflection Generation:} The key advantage of generative agents over standard LLMs lies in their reflection hierarchy. Following Park et al.'s framework, agents synthesize observations into increasingly abstract insights:

\textbf{Level 1 (Observations):} Direct preference patterns from data $\Rightarrow$
\textbf{Level 2 (Reflections):} Behavioral interpretations $\Rightarrow$ 
\textbf{Level 3 (Higher-order reflections):} Personality trait inference

This hierarchical processing produces insights such as:
\begin{quote}
\textit{"This user's preference for action and science fiction, combined with their technical profession, suggests they value movies that showcase technological innovation and explore the intersection of humanity and technology. Their demographic profile indicates they likely appreciate fast-paced entertainment that offers intellectual stimulation rather than emotional depth."}
\end{quote}

These emergent insights capture the \textit{why} behind preferences (something neither collaborative filtering nor one-shot LLM queries can achieve). The agent's coherent personality model ensures that seemingly disparate preferences (liking both "The Matrix" and "Inception") are unified under consistent personality traits ("values intellectual complexity in action narratives").

\textbf{Embedding Extraction from Personality Profiles:} To convert the agent's personality-based movie preferences into numerical vectors, we employ the following process:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Personality-Based Movie Preference Summary}: We synthesize the initialization profile and reflections into a comprehensive personality-driven preference description:
    \begin{quote}
    \textit{"Generate a movie recommendation profile based on this user's demographics and personality traits: [initialization + reflections]. Focus on preference patterns, movie characteristics they value, and decision-making factors for movie selection."}
    \end{quote}
    
    \item \textbf{Embedding Generation with Sentence-BERT}: The personality-based movie preference summary is encoded using Sentence-BERT~\cite{reimers2019sentence} to capture semantic preference patterns:
    \begin{equation}
    u^{gen}_i = \text{SentenceBERT}(\text{PersonalityPreferenceSummary}_i),    \label{eq:personality_encoding}
    \end{equation}
    where $u^{gen}_i\in \mathbb{R}^{768}$ captures personality-based movie preferences.
    

\end{enumerate}

 While $u^{cf}_i$ captures behavioral patterns from historical interactions, $u^{gen}_i$ captures personality-driven preferences that can explain \textit{why} users make certain choices and predict preferences for new or niche movies that lack sufficient collaborative signals.

\subsubsection{Attention-Based Fusion of User Representations}
\label{sec:attention_fusion}
The generative agent personality vectors $u^{gen}_i$ and collaborative filtering vectors $u^{cf}_i$ capture fundamentally different aspects of user preferences:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $u^{cf}_i$: Encodes \textit{what} users like based on behavioral patterns
    \item $u^{gen}_i$: Encodes \textit{why} users like items based on personality traits
\end{itemize}
To generate a comprehensive user representation that leverages both collaborative and personality signals, we employ an attention-based fusion mechanism.
% Consider alternative fusion strategies:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Concatenation}: $u_i = W[u^{cf}_i; u^{gen}_i]$ treats all users identically, potentially learning to ignore one representation entirely
%     \item \textbf{Fixed averaging}: $u_i = \alpha u^{cf}_i + (1-\alpha) u^{gen}_i$ assumes constant relative importance across all users
%     \item \textbf{Our attention approach}: Dynamically weights representations based on their alignment and reliability
% \end{itemize}

\textbf{Projection to Shared Space:} Due to the dimension mismatch between $u^{cf}_i \in \mathbb{R}^k$ and $u^{gen}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{768}$, we first project both vectors into a shared latent space of dimension $d$ using learned transformations:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{h}^{cf}_i = \mathbf{W}_{cf} u^{cf}_i + \mathbf{b}_{cf}, \quad \mathbf{h}^{gen}_i = \mathbf{W}_{gen} u^{gen}_i + \mathbf{b}_{gen},
\label{eq:projection_fusion}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{W}_{cf} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}$, $\mathbf{W}_{gen} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times 768}$ are trainable projection matrices, and $\mathbf{b}_{cf}, \mathbf{b}_{gen} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ are bias terms. These projections serve dual purposes: dimension alignment and representation enhancement through learned transformations.

\textbf{Attention Weight Computation:} We compute an attention score to dynamically determine the relative importance of collaborative versus personality signals for each user:

\begin{equation}
\phi = \sigma\left((\mathbf{h}^{cf}_i)^T \mathbf{h}^{gen}_i\right),
\label{eq:attention_weight}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma(\cdot)$ denotes the sigmoid function. This attention mechanism enables the model to automatically emphasize collaborative signals when interaction history is rich and personality signals when behavioral data is sparse.

\textbf{Fused User Vector:} The unified user vector is obtained as:

\begin{equation}
u_i = \phi \mathbf{h}^{gen}_i + (1 - \phi) \mathbf{h}^{cf}_i.
\label{eq:final_fusion}
\end{equation}

This approach enables dynamic control over the influence of collaborative filtering and generative agent representations, facilitating context-aware user modeling. All fusion parameters $\{\mathbf{W}_{cf}, \mathbf{W}_{gen}, \mathbf{b}_{cf}, \mathbf{b}_{gen}\}$ are learned end-to-end with the downstream recommendation objective, ensuring optimal integration for the specific recommendation task.
The attention mechanism's ability to identify alignment between behavioral and personality signals proves crucial for our hallucination detection strategy. When both representations agree on user preferences, we have higher confidence in semantic assessments, making our hallucination replacement strategy more effective.
\subsection{Transferring Collaborative Information into Online Learning}
\label{sec:transfer_learning}


To bridge offline collaborative signals with online adaptation capabilities, we need a mechanism that connects the learned user vectors $u_i$ with item characteristics. While collaborative filtering captures user-item interaction patterns, it cannot directly leverage item content features for unseen items. We address this limitation by learning a transfer matrix that maps item features to the collaborative latent space.
 The transfer learning matrix serves two critical purposes: (1) it enables our model to make predictions for new items that lack sufficient collaborative signals by leveraging their content features, and (2) it provides a foundation for online adaptation by establishing how item characteristics relate to user preferences in the learned latent space.

\subsubsection{Content-Feature Transfer Matrix}

We learn a transfer matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times f}$ that maps item content features to the collaborative latent space, where $f$ denotes the item feature dimensionality. For each movie $j$, we construct feature vector $x_j \in \mathbb{R}^f$ containing genre indicators, normalized release year, and TF-IDF representations of textual metadata.

Following Agarwal et al.~\cite{agarwal2010fast}, we optimize transfer matrice $\mathbf{A}$ as:
% \begin{equation}
% \mathbf{A}^* = \arg\min_{\mathbf{A}} \sum_{(i,j) \in \Omega} \left(r_{ij} - u_i^T \mathbf{A} x_j\right)^2 + \lambda_A \|\mathbf{A}\|^2_F,
% \label{eq:transfer_matrix}
% \end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A} = \left(\sum_{(i,j) \in \Omega} (r_{ij} - b_j) u_i x_j^T\right) \left(\sum_{(i,j) \in \Omega} x_j x_j^T + \lambda_A \mathbf{I}_f\right)^{-1},
\label{eq:transfer_solution}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega$ denotes observed interactions, $\lambda_A$ controls regularization and $\mathbf{I}_f \in \mathbb{R}^{f \times f}$ is the identity matrix, which serves as a regularization term to ensure the matrix inversion is well-conditioned.. 
\subsubsection{Low-Rank Projection Matrix}


To enable efficient online adaptation, we construct projection matrix $\mathbf{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times \ell}$ through principal component analysis of the user representation space. Following the reduced-rank regression approach of Agarwal et al.~\cite{agarwal2010fast}, we project to a lower-dimensional space ($\ell \ll k$) to achieve computational efficiency: online updates require only $O(\ell)$ operations instead of $O(k)$, and memory requirements are reduced by factor $k/\ell$. This approach leverages the insight that user preferences typically lie in lower-dimensional manifolds~\cite{koren2009matrix}.

We compute the user covariance matrix:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{P}_u = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (u_i - \bar{u})(u_i - \bar{u})^T,
\label{eq:user_covariance}
\end{equation}
and extract the top $\ell$ eigenvectors:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{V}_{pca}[:, 1:\ell]^T,
\label{eq:B_matrix_pca}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{V}_{pca}$ contains eigenvectors of $\mathbf{P}_u$ ordered by decreasing eigenvalue magnitude.


\textbf{Matrix A Interpretation:} Each row $\mathbf{A}_{k,:}$ represents how the $k$-th user latent factor relates to item features. For example, if users with high values in latent factor $k$ prefer action movies, then $\mathbf{A}_{k,\text{action}}$ will have a large positive value.

\textbf{Matrix B Interpretation:} Each column $\mathbf{B}_{:,\ell}$ represents a "collaborative direction" that captures patterns not explained by content. For instance, one direction might capture preferences for "cult classics" that span multiple genres but share subtle artistic qualities not captured in standard metadata.

\subsection{Hybrid Bilinear Scoring Function}
\label{sec:bilinear_scoring}

Our recommendation scoring function integrates content-based transfer learning with online adaptation capabilities through a mathematically unified bilinear model. Drawing inspiration from Agarwal et al.~\cite{agarwal2010fast}, we design a scoring function that grounds predictions in actual item features while enabling rapid adaptation to new interaction patterns.
 Our scoring function consists of two complementary components: (1) \textit{content-based transfer signals} that leverage item features through the transfer matrix learned in Section~\ref{sec:transfer_learning}, and (2) \textit{online adaptation terms} that enable real-time learning from new interactions. This helps to reduce the training time for LLMs which did not exist in other generative recommendation techniques.

\subsubsection{Component-wise Scoring Function}

\textbf{Component 1 - Content-Based Transfer Signal:} The foundation of our scoring function leverages item content information through the transfer matrix $\mathbf{A}$:
\begin{equation}
s^{(1)}_{ij} = u_i^T \mathbf{A} x_j,
\label{eq:transfer_component}
\end{equation}
where $u_i$ is the fused user vector from Section~\ref{sec:attention_fusion}, $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times f}$ is the transfer matrix, and $x_j \in \mathbb{R}^f$ contains item features (genres, release year, content metadata). This term provides a content-aware baseline prediction that captures how user preferences align with item characteristics.

\textbf{Component 2 - Online Adaptation Signal:} To enable rapid adaptation to new interaction patterns while maintaining computational efficiency, we introduce a low-rank online learning component:
\begin{equation}
s^{(2)}_{ij} = u_i^T \mathbf{B},\boldsymbol{\theta}_j
\label{eq:online_component}
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{\theta}_j \in \mathbb{R}^\ell$ is the item-specific factors adapted online. For each item $j$, the online adaptation vector $\boldsymbol{\theta}_j$ is initialized as:
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\theta}_j^{(0)} = \mathbf{0} \in \mathbb{R}^\ell.
\label{eq:theta_initialization}
\end{equation}

This zero initialization ensures that initial predictions rely entirely on the content-based component $u_i^T \mathbf{A} x_j$, with online adaptation occurring as interactions accumulate. Upon observing interaction $(i,j,r_{ij})$, we update $\boldsymbol{\theta}_j$ via gradient descent at $t-th$ interation:
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\theta}_j^{(t+1)} = \boldsymbol{\theta}_j^{(t)} + \eta_\theta \left[e_{ij} \cdot \mathbf{B}^T u_i - \lambda_\theta \boldsymbol{\theta}_j^{(t)}\right],
\label{eq:theta_update}
\end{equation}
where $e_{ij} = r_{ij} - \hat{r}_{ij}$ is the prediction error
\textbf{Contextual and Bias Terms:} We include additional terms to capture interaction-specific context and global item effects:
\begin{equation}
s^{(3)}_{ij} = w^T z_{ij} + b_j,
\label{eq:context_bias}
\end{equation}
where $z_{ij} \in \mathbb{R}^c$ contains contextual features (timestamp, user activity level, seasonal effects), $w$ is the context weight parameter and $b_j$ captures item-specific global popularity biases.

\subsubsection{Proposed Scoring Function}

Combining all components, the predicted rating $\hat{r}_{ij}$ from user $i$ to item $j$ is calculated from the combination of $s^{(1)}_{ij}, s^{(2)}_{ij}$  and $s^{(3)}_{ij}$ as: 
\begin{equation}
\hat{r}_{ij} = g\left(u_i^T \mathbf{A} x_j + u_i^T \mathbf{B} \boldsymbol{\theta}_j + w^T z_{ij} + b_j\right),
\label{eq:complete_scoring}
\end{equation}
where $g(\cdot)$ is a link function that maps the linear combination to the appropriate rating scale. For MovieLens ratings (1-5 scale), we use:
\begin{equation}
g(x) = 1 + 4 \cdot \sigma(x),
\label{eq:link_function}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma(\cdot)$ is the sigmoid function, ensuring predictions lie within [1,5].

In addition to the update of $\boldsymbol{\theta}_j$, item bias term $b_j$ and context weight vector $w$ require updates as the popularity and contextual patterns can change over time during the online phase. These update rules also follow SGD optimisation technique: 


\textbf{Item Bias Update:}
\begin{equation}
b_j^{(t+1)} = b_j^{(t)} + \eta_b \left[e_{ij} - \lambda_b b_j^{(t)}\right],
\end{equation}

\textbf{Context Weight Update:}
\begin{equation}
w^{(t+1)} = w^{(t)} + \eta_w \left[e_{ij} \cdot z_{ij} - \lambda_w w^{(t)}\right],
\end{equation}
where $\eta_w$ and $\eta_b$ is the learning rate for the context weight vector $w$ and bias term $b$ at different learning iteration $t$-th, respectively.
% \subsubsection{Theoretical Justification}

% \textbf{Hallucination Mitigation Properties:} Our scoring function inherently supports hallucination mitigation because:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item \textbf{Feature Grounding}: The primary term $u_i^T \mathbf{A} x_j$ requires actual item features $x_j$, making it impossible to generate predictions for non-existent items.
%     \item \textbf{Controlled Adaptation}: The online component $u_i^T \mathbf{B} \boldsymbol{\theta}_j$ adapts within the constrained space defined by $\mathbf{B}$, preventing arbitrary deviations from content-based predictions.
% \end{enumerate}
\subsection{Hallucination Detection and Replacement}
\label{sec:hallucination_mitigation}
While our scoring function optimizes for expected utility, it may create filter bubbles by consistently recommending similar items. The LLM step introduces controlled stochasticity and semantic exploration, discovering recommendations that are semantically coherent but might be overlooked by pure scoring.
The system will utilise the scoring function from Equation \ref{eq:complete_scoring} on the test dataset for each user $u$ and we will feed this predicted list of items $\mathcal{C}$ into LLM again for a semantic recommendation using the following prompt: 
\begin{quote}
"You are a recommendation system for a user with the following traits:
\textbf{        (personality preference)}
        
        Based on the user's profile and past behavior, you have retrieved the following relevant items:
\textbf{        (item list $\mathcal{C}$)}
        
        Please recommend 10 items from the list above that would be most relevant for this user.
        
        For each recommendation, provide a brief explanation of why it matches the user's preferences.
        
        IMPORTANT: You must ONLY recommend items from the provided list. Do not suggest any items that are not in the list."
\end{quote}
However, most of the time in our experiment, we found that LLM tended to provide items that were not existed in the test dataset as shown in Figure \ref{fig:llm_hallucination_evidence}. We address faithfulness hallucinations (recommendations of non-existent items in provided list) through a two-stage approach: binary detection followed by similarity-based replacement. Our method leverages the semantic intent of hallucinated recommendations while ensuring factual grounding in the actual item list.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{llm_hallucination_evidence.png}
\caption{LLM hallucination rates despite explicit prompting constraints on the test dataset. Even when explicitly instructed to recommend only from provided candidate lists, LLMs consistently generate non-existent items across all datasets, demonstrating the systematic nature of the hallucination problem in generative recommendation systems.}
\label{fig:llm_hallucination_evidence}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Binary Hallucination Detection}

Given a candidate item set $\mathcal{C}$ scored by our hybrid function and an LLM-generated recommendation $\hat{j}$, we perform binary classification:

\begin{equation}
h(\hat{j}) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \hat{j} \notin \mathcal{C} \text{ (hallucination)} \\
0 & \text{if } \hat{j} \in \mathcal{C} \text{ (valid recommendation)}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:hallucination_detection}
\end{equation}



When a hallucination is detected ($h(\hat{j}) = 1$), we formulate replacement as an optimization problem that balances semantic similarity with predicted user preference. We believe that despite providing hallucinated items, they are still meaningful and relevant based on the understanding of LLM. 
For hallucinated item $\hat{j}$ and user $u$, select replacement $j^* \in \mathcal{C}$:

\begin{equation}
j^* = \alpha \cdot \text{sim}(\hat{j}, j) + (1-\alpha) \cdot \hat{r}_{uj}
\label{eq:replacement_optimization}
\end{equation}

where $\text{sim}(\hat{j}, j)$ measures semantic similarity, $\hat{r}_{uj}$ is the predicted rating from our scoring function, and $\alpha \in [0,1]$ balances the objectives which is discussed in \ref{adaptive}. Using item feature vectors, $\text{sim}(\hat{j}, j)$ is calculated as: 

\begin{equation}
\text{sim}(\hat{j}, j) = \frac{x_{\hat{j}}^T x_j}{\|x_{\hat{j}}\|_2 \|x_j\|_2},
\label{eq:content_similarity}
\end{equation}
where $x_{\hat{j}}$ is extracted from the LLM's description of the hallucinated item using the same feature extraction process as legitimate items. This similarity function\textbf{ measures the level of pattern preservation} between hallucinated items and replaced items.
Particularly, we extract pseudo-features from LLM descriptions using the following prompt:
\begin{quote}
\textit{"Given this movie description: [LLM output], identify which of these genres apply: [list of 18 MovieLens genres]. Return a binary vector."}
\end{quote}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{preserved.png}
    \caption{Just for Professor and Dr's reference of how I replaced the item}
    \label{fig:replacement-table}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Adaptive Balance Parameter Learning}
\label{adaptive}
Rather than fixing $\alpha$, we learn a context-dependent balance function that adapts based on user characteristics and item properties. The optimal weighting between semantic similarity and predicted rating from Equation \ref{eq:replacement_optimization} should adapt to context. When users have rich interaction histories, collaborative signals are more reliable, so predicted ratings should be prioritized ($\alpha \to 0$). For highly specialized or niche items, or when hallucinated descriptions are particularly detailed, semantic similarity becomes more informative, warranting a higher similarity weight ($\alpha \to 1$).
We develop a parameter-free adaptive balance function that optimally weights semantic similarity versus predicted preference based on genre compatibility and user interaction history. Our approach addresses the fundamental trade-off between leveraging semantic intent from hallucinated recommendations and exploiting collaborative filtering signals.

\textbf{Genre Compatibility Measure:} To quantify the semantic alignment between hallucinated and candidate items, we employ the Jaccard similarity coefficient over genre sets:

\begin{equation}
s_{genre}(\hat{j}, j) = \frac{|\mathcal{G}_{\hat{j}} \cap \mathcal{G}_j|}{|\mathcal{G}_{\hat{j}} \cup \mathcal{G}_j|},
\label{eq:genre_jaccard}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{G}_{\hat{j}}$ and $\mathcal{G}_j$ are the genre sets for hallucinated item $\hat{j}$ and candidate item $j$, respectively. This measure is theoretically justified as it provides a normalized similarity score that accounts for both shared and distinct genres, ensuring that highly overlapping items receive higher similarity weights.

\textbf{User Experience Normalization:} We model user experience relative to the dataset population to account for varying interaction densities across users:

\begin{equation}
s_{exp}(u) = \min\left(1, \frac{|\mathcal{I}_u|}{\bar{I}_{all}}\right),
\label{eq:experience_normalization}
\end{equation}
where $|\mathcal{I}_u|$ represents user $u$'s interaction count and $\bar{I}_{all}$ is the mean interaction count across all users. This normalization is essential because it provides a dataset-agnostic measure of user experience—users with above-average interaction counts receive higher experience scores, indicating greater reliability of their collaborative filtering vectors.

 We combine these factors through a multiplicative formulation that captures the interaction between semantic compatibility and collaborative signal reliability:

\begin{equation}
\alpha = s_{genre}(\hat{j}, j) \times (1 - s_{exp}(u))
\label{eq:theoretical_alpha}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
\label{sec:metrics}
We employ metrics that comprehensively evaluate both exploitation performance and exploration capabilities:

\subsubsection{Exploitation Metrics (Accuracy)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Hit Rate@K} (HR@K): Fraction of test items appearing in top-K recommendations
\item \textbf{Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain@K} (NDCG@K): Position-weighted relevance score
\item \textbf{Mean Reciprocal Rank} (MRR): Average reciprocal rank of first relevant item
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Exploration Metrics (Diversity)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Intra-List Diversity} (ILD): Average pairwise dissimilarity within recommendation lists:
\begin{equation}
\text{ILD} = \frac{1}{|U|} \sum_{u \in U} \frac{2}{K(K-1)} \sum_{i<j} (1 - \text{sim}(r_i^u, r_j^u))
\end{equation}

\item \textbf{Coverage}: Fraction of catalog items recommended across all users:

% Table \ref{tab:overall_performance}, Table \ref{tab:yelp_performance} and \ref{tab:amazon_performance} present results across MovieLens-1M, Amazon Electronics, and Yelp datasets. HallAgent4Rec consistently achieves superior hallucination mitigation while maintaining competitive recommendation quality across all datasets, with performance patterns reflecting dataset characteristics.
% Traditional methods show declining performance from MovieLens-1M to Amazon Electronics due to extreme sparsity (99.97\%), where collaborative signals become insufficient. LightGCN performs best among traditional methods on MovieLens-1M (HR@10: 0.771) but degrades significantly on Amazon Electronics (0.642), demonstrating limitations of pure collaborative filtering in sparse settings. Generative methods exhibit opposite trends: GPT-Rec and RecAgent show better relative performance on Amazon Electronics where semantic understanding compensates for sparsity, but suffer from high hallucination rates (24.3\% and 17.8\% respectively) due to large, dynamic lists. FactRec reduces hallucinations through post-verification but at computational cost, limiting real-time applicability. Hybrid methods  attempt to balance both paradigms but maintain separate optimization objectives, leading to suboptimal integration.
% HallAgent4Rec demonstrates strongest relative improvements on Amazon Electronics, leveraging unified optimization to handle sparsity through semantic understanding while preventing hallucinations via learned projections. On denser MovieLens-1M, it matches LightGCN performance (HR@10: 0.784 vs. 0.771) while dramatically reducing hallucinations through integrated collaborative signals. Yelp shows intermediate gains, reflecting moderate sparsity and contextual richness.
% Across datasets, HallAgent4Rec achieves consistent 87\% hallucination rate reductions compared to GPT-Rec baselines, with attribute error reductions of 78-81\%. This consistency across diverse domains demonstrates framework robustness, where unified mathematical integration enables joint optimization of recommendation quality and hallucination mitigation. 
% Figure~\ref{fig:hall_vs_quality} visualises the trade-off between recommendation quality (HR@10) and hallucination rate. demonstrating that HallAgent4Rec occupies the optimal position with both high recommendation quality and low hallucination rate. Similar patterns are observed on the Amazon Electronics and Yelp datasets, as shown in Tables~\ref{tab:amazon_performance} and \ref{tab:yelp_performance}, demonstrating the robustness of our approach across different domains and data characteristics.

% % Notably, HallAgent4Rec shows stronger relative performance on the Amazon Electronics dataset, which has greater sparsity and a larger list. This suggests that our approach is particularly effective in challenging recommendation scenarios where traditional methods struggle due to data sparsity and generative methods are prone to hallucinations due to list complexity.

% % Figure~\ref{fig:hallucination_comparison} provides a cross-dataset comparison of hallucination rates, highlighting HallAgent4Rec's consistent performance advantages. Statistical significance tests (paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction \cite{torres2025projecrec}) confirm that HallAgent4Rec's improvements in Hallucination Rate are significant ($p < 0.01$) across all baselines and datasets. For recommendation quality metrics, improvements over generative baselines are significant ($p < 0.01$), while the differences with top collaborative filtering methods are not statistically significant ($p > 0.05$) on most datasets.

% \subsection{Hallucination Mitigation Effectiveness}
% To better understand the effectiveness of our hallucination mitigation approach, we analyse different types of hallucinations and the performance of our rating-aware replacement strategy. HallAgent4Rec reduces all types of hallucinations, with the most substantial reductions in "non-existent item" hallucinations (92\% reduction) and "attribute misattribution" hallucinations (78\% reduction). This demonstrates the effectiveness of our binary classification approach for detecting non-existent items and the semantic awareness of our replacement strategy for preserving relevant attributes.

% \subsubsection*{Hallucination Analysis}
% Figure~\ref{fig:hallucination_types} shows the breakdown of hallucinations by type across different generative recommendation methods on the MovieLens-1M dataset.

% \begin{figure}[h]

% \label{fig:hallucination_types}
% \end{figure}

% \subsubsection*{Replacement Strategy Effectiveness}
% To evaluate our rating-aware replacement strategy, we compare it with alternative approaches:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Popularity-based replacement: Replace hallucinated items with globally most popular items (highest interaction frequency across all users in the training set)
% \item Similarity-only replacement: Replace hallucinated items based only on cosine similarity between hallucinated item embeddings and candidate item embeddings in the semantic space ($\alpha = 1.0$)
% \item Rating-only replacement: Replace hallucinated items based only scoring function 
% \item HallAgent4Rec: Our balanced approach ($\alpha = 0.4$) where we incorporate the hallucination mitigation with scoring function
% \end{enumerate}

% \begin{table}[h]
% \centering
% \caption{Comparison of Replacement Strategies}
% \label{tab:replacement_strategies}
% \begin{tabular}{lcccc}
% \toprule
% \textbf{Replacement Strategy} & \textbf{User Satisfaction} & \textbf{Diversity} & \textbf{HR@10} & \textbf{Hall. Rate} \\
% \midrule
% Popularity-based & $3.65 \pm 0.21$ & 0.614 & 0.743 & 0.022 \\
% Similarity-only ($\alpha = 1.0$) & $4.02 \pm 0.18$ & 0.795 & 0.731 & 0.024 \\
% Rating-only ($\alpha = 0.0$) & $3.88 \pm 0.23$ & 0.682 & 0.768 & 0.021 \\

% \bottomrule
% \end{tabular}
% \end{table}

% Our rating-aware replacement strategy achieves the highest user satisfaction while maintaining good diversity. The popularity-based approach yields low diversity, while the similarity-only approach often suggests items with lower predicted relevance to the user. This confirms the importance of balancing semantic similarity and predicted rating in the replacement process.

% \subsubsection*{Feedback Loop Impact}
% To assess the effectiveness of our feedback loop mechanism, we measure hallucination rates over time as the system interacts with users. Figure~\ref{fig:feedback_loop} shows the hallucination rate for different methods over 10 interaction cycles on the MovieLens-1M dataset. HallAgent4Rec's hallucination rate decreases by 52\% after 10 interaction cycles, while other methods show minimal improvement or inconsistent patterns after incorporating a feedback loop. This demonstrates that our feedback loop effectively reduces future hallucinations by updating both the generative agent's memory and the matrix factorisation parameters.

% \subsection{Ablation Studies}
% To understand the contribution of each component in HallAgent4Rec, we conduct ablation studies by removing or replacing key components of our framework.
% %\subsubsection*{Component Contribution Analysis}
% Figure~\ref{fig:ablation_study} visualises the performance impact of removing different components from HallAgent4Rec on the MovieLens-1M dataset. The results show that:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Without memory-based embedding: Removing the temporally weighted memory mechanism reduces Hit Rate@10 by 9.2\% and increases Hallucination Rate by 15.0\%, highlighting the importance of the generative agent's memory for both recommendation quality and hallucination mitigation.
% \item Without projection matrix P: Replacing our learned projection with a simpler dimension reduction technique (PCA) decreases Hit Rate@10 by 6.5\% and increases Hallucination Rate by 10.0\%, confirming the value of our learned projection for preserving recommendation-relevant information.
% \item Without online learning: Removing the online adaptation mechanism reduces Hit Rate@10 by 4.8\% and increases Hallucination Rate by 5.0\%, particularly affecting performance for new items and evolving user preferences.
% \item Without rating awareness in replacement: Setting $\alpha = 1.0$ to rely solely on semantic similarity for replacement increases Hallucination Rate by 20.0\%, demonstrating the importance of considering predicted ratings in the replacement process.
% \item Without feedback loop: Disabling the memory updates based on hallucination corrections increases the long-term Hallucination Rate by 25.0\%, showing the crucial role of the feedback loop in continuous improvement.
% \end{enumerate}

% These results confirm that each component of HallAgent4Rec contributes significantly to its overall performance. %, with the memory-based embedding and feedback loop having the largest impact on hallucination mitigation.
% The memory-based embedding has the largest impact on recommendation quality by reducing the performance by 9.2\%, while removing the feedback loop increases hallucination rate the most (+25\%).

% % \subsection{Computational Efficiency Analysis}
% % Finally, we analyze the computational efficiency of HallAgent4Rec compared to baselines, focusing on training time, update time, and memory requirements.

While the initial training time is longer than pure collaborative filtering methods due to the generative component, it is significantly faster than other generative approaches at inference time. Importantly, our online update mechanism requires only 48ms per interaction on average, enabling real-time adaptation in practical deployment scenarios.

% % Figure~\ref{fig:scalability} shows how training time, update time, and memory usage scale with dataset size. The results indicate that HallAgent4Rec scales near-linearly with the number of users and items, with our selective parameter update strategy and reduced-rank formulation being key enablers of this scalability. This makes HallAgent4Rec suitable for large-scale recommendation scenarios where both semantic richness and computational efficiency are required.
\section{Results \& Analysis}
\label{sec:results}

We systematically evaluate HallAgent4Rec across three datasets with varying characteristics to address our research questions. Our analysis reveals fundamental insights into why existing approaches fail and how our unified framework resolves these limitations.

\subsection{RQ1: Hallucination Reduction Effectiveness}

HallAgent4Rec achieves 87\% hallucination reduction compared to baseline generative methods while maintaining competitive recommendation quality. As shown in Table~\ref{tab:rq1_results}, our method consistently reduces hallucination rates to 2.0-3.2\% across all datasets, compared to 15.4-24.3\% for pure generative approaches. This dramatic improvement stems from our unified mathematical framework that makes hallucinations structurally impossible rather than relying on post-hoc detection.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
}
\end{table}

The failure of existing generative methods can be attributed to the fundamental semantic-algebraic disconnect: LLMs operate in continuous semantic space while recommendation requires discrete item selection from finite catalogs. GPT-Rec and RecAgent suffer hallucination rates of 15.4-24.3\% because they generate semantically plausible but non-existent items. FactRec attempts post-hoc verification but faces computational bottlenecks that limit real-time applicability, while verification cannot recover semantic intent when replacing hallucinated items. Hybrid methods like BERT4Rec+MF and LLM-CF treat semantic and collaborative components as independent modules with separate optimization objectives, preventing unified optimization and leading to conflicting gradients at module boundaries.

Our approach succeeds because the unified bilinear scoring function makes hallucinations mathematically impossible through feature grounding. The term $u_i^T \mathbf{A} x_j$ requires actual item features $x_j$, preventing predictions for non-existent items, while the reduced-rank online component $u_i^T \mathbf{B} \boldsymbol{\theta}_j$ operates within the constrained subspace defined by $\mathbf{B}$, preventing arbitrary deviations from content-based predictions.

\subsection{RQ2: Recommendation Quality Preservation}

Our unified CF-LLM integration not only maintains but improves recommendation quality compared to pure collaborative filtering while adding hallucination resistance. Table~\ref{tab:rq2_quality} demonstrates our method's consistent performance across varying dataset characteristics, while Figure~\ref{fig:rq2_sparsity} illustrates how different approaches handle sparsity challenges.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{quality_sparsity_analysis (2).png}
\caption{Performance degradation analysis across sparsity levels. Traditional CF methods show steep decline with increasing sparsity, while our unified approach maintains robust performance through adaptive attention mechanism.}
\label{fig:rq2_sparsity}
\end{figure}
Traditional collaborative filtering methods degrade significantly with sparsity because matrix factorization requires sufficient interaction density to learn meaningful latent factors. On Amazon Electronics (99.97\% sparsity), LightGCN's performance drops 16.7\% compared to MovieLens due to insufficient collaborative signals—the mathematical requirement $\mathbf{R} \approx \mathbf{U}\mathbf{V}^T$ becomes ill-conditioned when most entries are unobserved. Pure generative methods show inconsistent quality patterns, performing relatively better on sparse datasets where semantic understanding compensates for missing collaborative signals, but lacking the behavioral grounding necessary for accurate preference prediction since they optimize for semantic plausibility rather than user-item fit.

Table~\ref{tab:rq2_attention} demonstrates how our attention mechanism automatically adapts to dataset characteristics, explaining the consistent quality improvements across varying sparsity levels.


\subsection{RQ3: Replacement Strategy Effectiveness}

Our adaptive replacement strategy outperforms fixed approaches by learning context-dependent trade-offs between semantic similarity and predicted relevance. Table~\ref{tab:rq3_results} demonstrates that fixed strategies fail because they cannot resolve the fundamental tension between preserving semantic intent and ensuring predicted relevance. Users with sparse rating histories require semantic similarity emphasis due to insufficient collaborative data, while users with dense histories benefit from rating prediction priority given reliable collaborative signals.

Our parameterless function $\alpha(u, \hat{j}, j) = s_{genre}(\hat{j}, j) \times (1 - s_{exp}(u))$ automatically learns optimal trade-offs by adapting to user interaction density and genre compatibility. For users with sparse interactions, $s_{exp}(u) \rightarrow 0$ makes $\alpha \rightarrow s_{genre}$, emphasizing semantic similarity when collaborative data is insufficient. Conversely, for users with dense interactions, $s_{exp}(u) \rightarrow 1$ makes $\alpha \rightarrow 0$, prioritizing rating predictions when collaborative signals are reliable. This adaptive mechanism achieves 15-20\% higher user satisfaction than fixed alternatives while maintaining both recommendation diversity and accuracy.

\subsection{RQ4: Component Contribution Analysis}

Each framework component provides essential functionality, with dual user vector having the largest individual impact and component interactions creating non-additive benefits. Figure~\ref{fig:rq4_analysis} reveals that dual user representation removal causes the largest performance degradation (-9.2\% HR@10), confirming that attention-based fusion of collaborative and personality vectors captures complementary information unavailable to either paradigm alone. Analysis reveals that $\phi$ values adapt meaningfully to user characteristics rather than performing mere ensemble averaging.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ablation_insights_corrected.png}
\caption{Component ablation analysis revealing individual contributions and interaction effects. I want to show my chart c to show the link of dependence but I need your advice on how to write it in this section}
\label{fig:rq4_analysis}
\end{figure}

Transfer matrix learning shows the second-largest impact (-6.5\% HR@10 when removed), validating the importance of supervised learning for matrix $\mathbf{A}$ that creates task-relevant mappings between item features and collaborative latent factors. Replacing with unsupervised PCA shows significant degradation, confirming the value of end-to-end optimization. The low-rank projection matrix contributes -4.8\% HR@10 impact, with eigenvalue analysis showing 89.7\% variance preservation using only 16 factors, achieving computational efficiency without information loss. Online adaptation mechanisms contribute -4.2\% HR@10, enabling rapid adaptation to new interaction patterns while maintaining hallucination resistance through the constrained subspace defined by $\mathbf{B}$. Rating-aware replacement proves critical for hallucination mitigation, with removal increasing hallucination rates by +20.0\%, demonstrating that binary detection followed by adaptive replacement successfully preserves semantic intent while ensuring factual accuracy.

Component interactions reveal system-level benefits beyond individual contributions. Removing component pairs shows non-additive effects with 1.0-3.0\% additional degradation, indicating that our unified optimization creates emergent advantages. The synchronized learning of all parameters produces performance gains that exceed the sum of individual components, validating our architectural design choices and the importance of end-to-end optimization rather than modular combination.

% \subsection{Computational Efficiency and Practical Implications}

% Our offline-online learning strategy achieves computational scalability necessary for real-world deployment. The framework requires only 15±3ms per query compared to 1000-1600ms for pure generative methods, representing a 70× speedup while adding minimal overhead (25\%) over traditional collaborative filtering. This efficiency stems from offline semantic extraction and reduced-rank online adaptation, enabling real-time deployment at scale without sacrificing the semantic understanding that makes generative recommendation valuable.

% The consistent performance improvements across diverse datasets with varying characteristics (95.53\% to 99.97\% sparsity) demonstrate framework robustness. Unlike existing approaches that require different hyperparameters or architectures for different domains, our unified mathematical integration automatically adapts to data characteristics through learned attention mechanisms, providing practical advantages for real-world deployment where manual tuning is impractical.

% These findings establish that the semantic-algebraic disconnect in current generative recommendation systems can be resolved through principled mathematical integration rather than post-hoc fixes, enabling the development of scalable, reliable generative recommendation systems that combine the best aspects of both paradigms while eliminating their individual limitations.
% These findings validate our central thesis that the semantic-algebraic disconnect in current generative recommendation systems can be resolved through principled mathematical integration rather than post-hoc fixes.
% \section{Conclusion \& Future Work}
% This paper introduced HallAgent4Rec, a novel framework that enhances generative recommendation agents through principled hallucination mitigation. We conducted extensive experiments on three public datasets spanning different domains, demonstrating that HallAgent4Rec achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of hallucination mitigation while maintaining recommendation quality comparable to the best collaborative filtering methods. Our approach makes several key contributions to the field of recommendation systems:

% First, we presented a unified mathematical framework that seamlessly integrates generative agents with matrix factorisation. Through carefully designed projection techniques, we bridge the semantic understanding capabilities of generative models with the algebraic structure 
% %and computational efficiency of collaborative filtering approaches. 
% This integration preserves the contextual awareness that makes generative agents valuable while addressing their limitations in terms of reliability and computational requirements.

% Second, we developed a principled approach to hallucination mitigation that combines binary classification for detection with a rating-aware replacement strategy. This approach not only identifies hallucinated recommendations but also provides high-quality replacements that balance semantic similarity with predicted user relevance. Our experimental results demonstrate that this strategy reduces hallucination rates by 32-87\% compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining competitive recommendation quality.


% Third, we implemented a comprehensive feedback loop that continuously improves recommendation quality by updating both the generative agent's memory and the matrix factorisation parameters based on hallucination corrections. This creates a self-improving system that demonstrates decreasing hallucination rates over time, with our experiments showing a 52\% reduction in hallucinations after 10 interaction cycles.

% Our ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component to the overall performance, and our case studies provide qualitative insights into the operation of our framework.
\section{CONCLUSION \& FUTURE WORK}

\subsection{Conclusion}
We introduced HallAgent4Rec, a unified framework addressing hallucination challenges in LLM-based recommendation systems. Our approach reduces hallucination rates by 32-87\% compared to baselines while achieving 70$\times$ computational speedup (15$\pm$3ms vs 1000-1600ms per query). The framework integrates collaborative filtering with generative agents through attention-based fusion and learned projection matrices, enabling both semantic understanding and algebraic efficiency.

Key contributions include: (1) a mathematically principled CF-LLM integration that makes hallucinations structurally impossible through feature grounding, (2) an adaptive replacement strategy balancing semantic similarity with predicted relevance, and (3) efficient online learning enabling real-time deployment. Experiments across three datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements and 52\% additional hallucination reduction through continual learning.

\subsection{Limitations \& Future Work}
Current limitations include evaluation scope restricted to traditional rating datasets and reliance on demographic data for personality vectors. 

Future directions include: extending to multi-modal and sequential recommendation scenarios, developing theoretical convergence guarantees for online components, exploring federated approaches for privacy-preserving personality generation, and comprehensive evaluation on industrial-scale datasets. The modular architecture enables systematic exploration of these extensions while preserving core hallucination mitigation properties.
